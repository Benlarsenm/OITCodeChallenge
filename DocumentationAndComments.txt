Time spent on challenge: 4 hrs


File Explantions:
WorkingSourceCode.cpp - This is the code that the .exe file was created from.
OITChallengeEXE.exe - The program executable. 
SourceCode ofNextStep.cpp - This is what was working on next. I couldn't get it to work correctly though so the
	the executable that I create was made from the working function I had.

Solution Requirements: 
	The solution is a console app so you will need to use the Windows command line 
	to see the results. Within the directory that the executable file is located, type "OITChallengeEXE.exe"
	to run the program.

Opening Source code:
	Any text editor that supports .cpp files should open the source code. Visual Studio works great.

Issues/Next Step:
	I after creating a function for converting Roman numerals to Normal numbers my code kept dropping the first
 	Roman numeral input so my conversion for this part always off by the amount of the first roman numeral.  
	I was trying to get the code to work just fine putting this logic into the main function.  This is what I 
	submitted as the program.  I ran out of time troubleshooting this step.  

	After I got that function to work, I was planning on adding a simple selection menu at the beginning. That
 	would ask the user to input “n” if they want to go from Roman Numeral to Normal number, or “r” if they 
	wanted to go from a Normal Number to a Roman numeral.  After doing this I was planning on implement the 
	function for converting a Normal number to a Roman numeral.  I didn’t have the chance to think about the 
	logic of this because of the bugs that I ran into.
